# Allan's Simple Go Chat (chit-chat) with Simple AngularJS UI

This is the original chit-chat written in GO from Allan Maxwell Blair's Blog article http://www.amaxwellblair.com/posts/simple_chat_app_using_go.  I simply added an angular UI to it so that it was useable by everyone.  If you want to try it, clone the repo and start chit-chat.go with the command
`go run chit-chat.go`.  After that you can simply navigate to http://localhost:9000/ to be presented with the web front end.  Enter your name and start chatting.

Next Steps are:

* Add History to the room
* Multiple rooms
* Proper login/user profile
* Emojis

Enjoy!!!
