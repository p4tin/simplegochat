# Allan's Simple Go Chat (chit-chat) with Simple AngularJS UI

### Instructions

This is the original chit-chat written in GO from Allan Maxwell Blair's Blog article http://www.amaxwellblair.com/posts/simple_chat_app_using_go.  I simply added an angular UI to it so that it was useable by everyone.  If you want to try it, clone the repo and start chit-chat.go with the command
`go run chit-chat.go`.  After that you can simply navigate to http://localhost:9000/ to be presented with the web front end.  Enter your name and start chatting.

### Test Server
You can try it out at: http://simplechat.gocodecloud.com/

### Next Steps are:

1. Add History to the room  
1. Multiple rooms  
1. Proper login/user profile  
1. Emojis  

### Remember to have fun...
